# About this project

Company t-shirts are usually cheap and boring. We tried to make it different and we came up with tech constellations.
The logo of each technology/language/framework we like and use daily was transformed into constellation. 
We found the end result to be great so we want to share it with you. 
So here they are - (probably) worlds first open-source t-shirts.

# Assets and usage

CONSTELLATIONS_by_TEONITE.ai is an Ilustrator file with assets we made for use on TEONITE's t-shirts projects. 
Feel free to use them in your project. Word of advice: try to achive high contrast between objects and shirt main color.

HOW_TO_START.ai is a quick tutorial on "How to create your own constellation". You might find it useful.

For logo spacing and placement, as well as additional tweaks consult sample .ai files. These are files that were 
used in printing our version of male and female fullprint shirts. 

The font used in the project is Exo 2 which you can download here: http://ndiscovered.com
